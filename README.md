I made a linear regression model,
the main objective of this model to predict the salary according to experience
at first i trained the model from trained data where i fedding input and output of trained data .After training,i fed the test data as input and observed the predicted salary.
then i calculated the mean square error(difference between actual and predicted value),which describe accuracy of model.

Algorithm:for the trained data model, i assume aa equation  y=m*x+b where i calculated "m" and "c";
and find line

1. Get the predicted salary from the test data(Areas).
2. Take the difference between the actual salary of test data and the Predicted salary of test data.
3. Square all the differences and take their mean By keeping the mean squared error minimum model, find the line which best suits the predicted values.
